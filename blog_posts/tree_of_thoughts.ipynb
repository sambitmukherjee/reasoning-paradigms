        "The *Tree of Thoughts* (ToT) paper (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601\" target=\"_blank\">Yao et al.</a>) demonstrates how to couple the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with a heuristic-guided tree search framework. But before diving into its implementation, let's set the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs are designed for autoregressive text generation. This makes them confined to token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference. According to the authors of the ToT paper, this is reminiscent of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The \"*System 1*\" (fast, automatic, unconscious) mode of thinking in humans.\n",
        "- The associative \"*model-free*\" paradigm in reinforcement learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the right type of prompt, this autoregressive mechanism elicits chain of thought (CoT) reasoning (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903\" target=\"_blank\">Wei et al.</a>), allowing LLMs to tackle a wide range of tasks requiring mathematical, symbolic, commonsense, and knowledge reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, generating a reasoning trace in a left-to-right manner falls short for tasks that need exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play an important role (because future decisions depend on them).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the ToT paper, the authors suggest that left-to-right CoT reasoning might benefit from augmentation by a heuristic-guided tree search framework. This is reminiscent of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The \"*System 2*\" (slow, deliberate, conscious) mode of thinking in humans.\n",
        "- The paradigm of deliberate \"*model-based*\" planning in reinforcement learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the authors, such a system is characterized by two key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The ability to maintain and explore diverse alternatives for current, i.e., local (node-level) decisions.\n",
        "2. The ability to evaluate each node, and actively look ahead or backtrack to make global decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Such a system would be able to consider multiple different reasoning paths, self-evaluate choices to decide the next course of action, as well as look ahead or backtrack when necessary to make global choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is a comparison of the ToT paradigm with three other popular reasoning paradigms."

            "As a child, John always had a knack for gymnastics. He was more comfortable in the world upside down, doing handstands and cartwheels, than others were walking on their two feet. His skills would later prove to be beneficial in his career as an astronaut, where physical fitness was a top priority. As he trained for his first mission, he found comfort in the old familiarity of handstands, an exercise that was part of their zero-gravity training. He would often tell his colleagues, \"It isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.\"\n",

            "When John finally made it to space, it was nothing like he expected. The zero-gravity, the silence, and the view were all breathtaking. But what caught his attention the most was the smell. After removing his helmet inside the spacecraft, a strong, strange aroma filled his nostrils. It was almost like... seared steak. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n",

            "Back on Earth, John was a quiet and reserved man. He disliked the attention he got from being an astronaut, especially from women who were more interested in his status than him. He found a clever way to deal with unwanted advances. He remembered a friend who was deaf and communicated through sign language. When she didn’t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.\n",

            "To his colleagues, John was a strong and capable astronaut. To the women he rebuffed, he was a strange man who suddenly became mute. To his old gymnastics coach, he was a talented gymnast who could've won medals. Each person had a different story about John, a different perception. Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.\n"

To many, the idea of balancing one's entire body weight on their hands seems nearly impossible.

        "Ok. It's time to take a look at the `dfs` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** The ToT paper didn't demonstrate DFS on the *Creative Writing* task. (It only demonstrated BFS.) But we shall demonstrate it nonetheless.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `dfs` method is a customized version of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Inside the `dfs` method, there is a variable called `dfs_output` (with an initial value of `None`). In case of a successful search, the output of the search will be recorded in this variable. In case of an unsuccessful search, the value of this variable will remain `None`.\n",
        "2. DFS is best executed using recursion. Hence, we've utilized a nested recursive function - `dfs_func` - inside the `dfs` method. This nested function returns a Boolean: `True` if the search is successful, and `False` otherwise.\n",
        "3. The base case is the following: `if step > self.n_steps`. But why? Well, it is assumed that if the current step has exceeded the number of steps required to solve the problem, then the search is successful. For example, in the *Game of 24* task, `self.n_steps` is always equal to `4` (`3` intermediate steps + `1` output generation step). Hence, if the current step exceeds `4`, we record the output in the `nonlocal` variable `dfs_output`, and then backtrack all the way up by returning `True`.\n",
        "4. In the recursive case, we generate thought candidates from the current node. Each of these thought candidates is added as a child of the current node.\n",
        "5. Now, it's time to loop through the children. For each child, we obtain a value from the state evaluator.\n",
        "6. We use a *heuristic threshold* to decide whether to grow a subtree (starting at this child) or prune it. After a bit of experimentation, we found that a heuristic threshold of `3.0` works well for this task.\n",
        "7. If the value of a child fails to exceed the heuristic threshold, then the child node is pruned, i.e., a subtree of the child isn't grown.\n",
        "8. Otherwise, we grow and search the subtree using the following recursive call: `end_search = dfs_func(child, step + 1)`.\n",
        "9. If `end_search` happens to be `True`, it means that the search was successful. In that case, we backtrack all the way up by returning `True`.\n",
        "10. If `end_search` happens to be `False`, we don't return anything. Rather, we move on to the next child.\n",
        "11. To provide more control over the search, an additional hyperparameter `max_per_state` is used. This hyperparameter specifies the maximum number of children to explore for a particular node. If the number of children explored touches `max_per_state`, we break the loop.\n",
        "12. If looping through the children didn't lead to a successful search, then the current node seems like a dead end. In that case, we backtrack to the parent node. The search will continue...\n",
        "\n",
        "All right, let's actually call the `dfs` method. By passing `verbose=True`, we can watch the DFS algorithm in action.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get a feel for the algorithm, let's initially set `max_per_state` to an unreasonably low value: `2`. (Since we're not allowing enough children to be explored at each node, the search will fail. This is deliberate. We want to see the backtracking in action in the search trace.)"

        "The ToT paper draws inspiration from the seminal work on artificial intelligence by Newell, Shaw & Simon from the 1950s. <a href=\"http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/rand/ipl/P-1584_Report_On_A_General_Problem-Solving_Program_Feb59.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Newell et al.</a> characterized problem solving as search through a combinatorial problem space, represented as a tree. But what's a combinatorial problem space? From the ToT paper:\n",
